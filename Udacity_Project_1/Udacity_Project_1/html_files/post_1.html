                    Welcome to my blog! I am a self taught developer from <u>Long Island, NY</u>.
                    I started my journey is an <i>odd</i> way, for lack of a better term.
                    Originally I was aiming to become a <i><b>Swahili</b></i> language tutor,
                    but soon after reaching my goal I noticed a shortage in websites and apps for the content I sought.
                    Thus my tech journey began...but let me tell you some other things about me.
                    Firstly let me explain that because of my connection to the <i><b>Swahili</b></i>
                    language, in many business situations (translation/teaching Swahili) I go my the name 
                    <i><b>Mfalme Jabali Ekevu</b></i> (<i>mmmm-fall-may jah-bah-lee eh-cav-oo</i>).
                    So please do not be alarmed by that name on Social Media, I have grown to love the name and often use it outside of business.
                    In other news, my parents were born in the island of <i><b>Jamaica</b></i>, 
                    my father in <i>Trelawny</i> and my mother in <i>St. Andrew</i>.
                    I however was born in Hempstead, Long Island, NY in July of 1993.
                    I have always loved sports and still play my favorite sport, <i><b>Lacrosse</b></i>, until today. Well that is a little about myself. 
                    I will include links to some of my social media pages below! ⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇
