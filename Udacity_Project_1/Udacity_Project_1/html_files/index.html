                        Welcome to my blog! I am a self taught developer from <u>Long Island, NY</u>.
                    I started my journey is an <i>odd</i> way, for lack of a better term.
                    Originally I was aiming to become a <i><b>Swahili</b></i> language tutor,
                    but soon after reaching my goal I noticed a shortage in websites and apps for the content I sought.
                    Thus my tech journey began.....
