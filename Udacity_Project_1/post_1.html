                    No matter what angle you take...when it comes to languages there will never a cut and dry answer. Language is alive, and thus constantly growing, which ultimaley means it is constantly changing. If you really want to add more complexity to the conversation just mention that programming lanuages are in fact languages too!
                    However for this blog we will focus on the spoken ones only, which without,  would make it really difficult to even bridge the gap between <i>man</i> and <i>binary</i>. 
                    So lets dive in!...but 1st lets set our course of action! 
                    Whenever I ask myself this question (though I am biased to African languagesüòäüòä) I always break it down into 4 parts.
                    Though the components you use may differ, we will approach the question as follows....

                    Well now would be a great time to site my sources..

                    There is a keyword in one of the resource links that really changes the dynamic of the convo, yet when having these conversations it is often overlooked.
                    The word is "TOTAL". I often feel this is done to control the narrative, but that isn't what I am here to discuss today. 
                    However just keep in mind that everything I list or say is based on the total amount of speakers, meaning 1st, 2nd, 3rd language speakers etc. 
                    So according to the video posted by Imperial Statistics ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdaLK5b1df4">Most Spoken Languages 2300 (Top 25 Languages by TOTAL number of speakers 1900-2300)</a></li>),
                    if we look at the top 25 most spoken languages in the year 2022 (pause the video on the year (2022) if you want to double check) are as follows..

                    If you're a language lover or even if you've only checked out a few lists on languages in the past this list should look VERY different from the norm. 
                    If you do your research (or just finish watching the video üòÇüòÇ) you will find there are several languages with serious growth potential here (Kiswahili Kitukuzwe üòÅüòé).
                </p>
                <h3 class="styles1">Which of these languages are used/growing in the business/tech world</h3>
                <div>
                    <p class="styles2">
                        Admittedly this section, along with the final section, is very opinion based. There are new businesses and tech companies forming everyday so for this one I will just say "DO..YOUR..RESEARCH!". Just pick whichever language you may be interested in and research what companies and new businesses are out there. 
                        Are speakers of said language in demand in a certain field? 
                        For example, over the past year along my journey of getting into the tech field I have met literally hundreds of Hindi and Punjabi speakers. 
                        Thus I found it to be worthwhile to begin learning Hindi. 
                        I still haven't reached far in the language but I have already had beautiful experiences with fellow "techies" when I simply greet them in Hindi. 
                        People seem to want to connect and help you even more when you make such efforts to communicate in their language.
                        On the reverse side, what if you cant find speakers of your target language as easily in the business/tech space? Does this mean it's not worth it to learn?
                        ....NO! A language that isn't currently viewed as a language of tech is what brought me into tech!...
                        Sometimes if you can't easily find the things you desire you have to put yourself in the position to create it!

                <h3 class="styles1">What are the projections for the future top 25 languages</h3>
                <div>
                    <p class="styles2">
                        This section is pretty important to me  when picking a language to learn (I only acutally speak 3 very well..4 if you count my parents native "language" Jamaican Patois). Languages come and go as they have done since the beginning....but for me, I can't wrap my head around learning a dead or dying language. 
                        This is why for years now I have sought out the projections of where languages will be rather than where they currently are.
                        Seeking such info is how I landing on the video from Imperial Statistics. 
                        I know which languages im pursuing but maybe you may want to see a side by side comparison of where your favorite languages in the top 25 are, and where they will be (that is..if they are still in the top 25 üòÇ)
                        The video show projections up to the year 2300 so i've provided a list for 2022 and 2300. Have a look below!!....‚¨á‚¨á‚¨á‚¨á‚¨á

                    So definetly choose a language that has potenial and you can possibly make money from but if you love it let that weigh more than anything.
